# 10-Channel circuit SPI PCB reference design files

## About
StretchSense is a global supplier of soft sensors. These soft sensors are perfect for measuring the complex movements of people and soft objects in our environments. 

### Background
This repository contains the hardware design files for the 10 channel circuit designed by StretchSense Ltd.  These are [available for purchase](https://stretchsense.com/shop) as a part of the StretchSense discovery kits on the StretchSense website. Explore the datasheet and quick-start guide on our [resources](https://stretchsense.com/article-resources/) page for more info about the circuit. 

### Why release these designs?
We want to help you take the next step in your product development cycle. These design files will allow you to integrate our brains into your electronics hub, easing the prototyping of products that bring multiple sensor types together. The idea is for these files to be a "drop-in" to your existing PCB design, and with our pre-programmed sensing IC you will be up and running with as little effort as possible. 

### What's included?
**Altium** - Schematic and board files for the 10 channel circuit. We use Altium for the development of our sensing circuitry. If you have other requirements please [contact us](https://stretchsense.com/contact-us/) and we will try to provide you with something you can work with. 

**BOM** - Current bill of materials for the latest version of the 10 channel circuit. Includes part numbers labels from design files, component values, and quantities.

**Datasheets** - Datasheets for the important components used on the 10 channel circuit, including the STM32F105R8 which is available as a pre-programmed IC from StretchSense, just [get in contact with our sales team](https://stretchsense.com/contact-us/). Our pre-programmed sensing IC contains 10 years worth of sensing algorithm refinement. Our circuitry removes any head aches around electronic/mathematical development on your side. 

**PDFs** - Includes detailed descriptions of component placement on the 10 channel circuit. Also includes mechanical drawings and a detailed schematic of the 10 channel circuit for reference and debugging.
